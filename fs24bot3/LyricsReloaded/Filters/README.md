Filter
======

Filters are small functions that can modify the given content.
Filters can currently be applied to variable values and the lyrics
content.

***Important***: The filters are executed in the specified order, so stripping HTML-tags
                 before converting \<br\> tags to newlines won't get you far.

entity_decode
-------------
This filter decodes HTML entities like \&copy; -> ©.


strip_links
-----------
This filter removes links from the lyrics.

converting tabs to spaces, vertical tabs to newlines and
removing unnecessary newlines and spaces.

Optionally you can provide a culture name as the first argument.

This filter is specialized version of diacritics2ascii that handles
only the german umlauts and replaces them with their two character
representation, so "äöüß" becomes "aeoeuess".

regex
-----

and the second argument is the replacement which may contain backreferences.
Optionally a third argument can be given which specifies regex options

Example usage: [regex, '\\s+?', " "]


strip_nonascii
--------------
This filter removes all non-ASCII characters.
The filter has 2 optional arguments: The first is a replacement for
the removed character and the second one specifies whether the replacement
can be inserted multiple times in a row.

Examples:

* strip_nonascii                 -> "test *** test" -> "testtest"
* [strip_nonascii, -]            -> "test *** test" -> "test-test"
* [strip_nonascii, -, duplicate] -> "test *** test" -> "test-----test"
